Okay.

### Intermediate
* Add a legend to the heatmap showing how many posts each shade of blue represents.
* When a cell in the heatmap is hovered, display a count of the number of posts.
* Create a date range selector that will filter the data so that the heatmap displays only the data that fits within the specified date range.
* Aggregate discussion from all of your courses instead of one course.
* Create a way to show switch between showing just TA/Instructor posts and all posts.
